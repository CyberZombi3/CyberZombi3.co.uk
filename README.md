So I'm a IT Security Analyst with many years experience in the IT industry, Always a keen lover in the old red teaming \ pen testing but lets be fair when I was younger it was just known as hacking. I'll try and keep my blogs helpful and easy to understand unlike some blogs, with that said happy reading.
